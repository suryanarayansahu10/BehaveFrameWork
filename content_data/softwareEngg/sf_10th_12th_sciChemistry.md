## How Does The Chemistry Gives Imapactful Knowledge In +2/12th-Science

Chemistry explores the composition, properties, and reactions of substances. In 12th class, students study organic chemistry (carbon compounds), inorganic chemistry (elements), and physical chemistry (reaction mechanisms). These concepts are foundational for understanding material science and biochemistry applications. Chemistry helps students develop analytical skills needed for careers in software engineering related to chemical modeling or pharmaceutical simulations. It also supports interdisciplinary fields like computational chemistry, where software tools are used to solve chemical problems.
