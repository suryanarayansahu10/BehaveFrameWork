## How Does The Automation and Instrumentation Engineering (AE&I) Gives Imapactful Knowledge In B.Tech? How dose It help in Your Career?

B.Tech in Automation and Instrumentation Engineering (AE&I) is a four-year undergraduate program focused on automation, process control, and measurement systems. The curriculum encompasses sensors, transducers, control systems, robotics, and industrial automation technologies. Students develop practical skills through lab work, simulations, and projects, preparing them for careers in manufacturing, process industries, and robotics.

**The benefits of pursuing a B.Tech degree in AE&I:**
Graduates can work as automation engineers, instrumentation engineers, control engineers, or robotics engineers. For example, they might design automated production lines for manufacturing plants or develop control algorithms for industrial robots. The course provides a strong foundation in automation and control principles and prepares students for the challenges of modern industrial automation. Top recruiters include Honeywell, Siemens, and Yokogawa.
