## What does a Diploma mean, How dose It help in Your Career

A diploma is a short-term technical or vocational course designed to provide practical knowledge in specific fields. In India, diplomas are regulated by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and are often referred to as Polytechnic courses. These programs typically last three years and can be pursued after completing 10th or 12th grade. Diplomas are cost-effective, have lower fees compared to degrees, and offer faster entry into the workforce. They focus on industry-specific skills, enabling students to secure jobs in engineering, IT, or applied arts. Students can also opt for lateral entry into B.Tech programs after completing their diploma. For example, a diploma in IT equips students with programming and networking skills, preparing them for roles like software developer or system administrator.
