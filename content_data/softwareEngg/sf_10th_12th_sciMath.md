## How Does The Mathematics/Math Gives Imapactful Knowledge In +2/12th-Science

Mathematics is the study of numbers, shapes, and patterns. In 12th class, students learn calculus (differentiation/integration), algebra (equations), geometry (shapes), and statistics (data analysis). These topics are crucial for software engineering as they form the basis of algorithms, data structures, machine learning models, and cryptography. Mathematics enhances logical thinking and problem-solving abilities required for coding complex systems or designing efficient programs. A strong grasp of math enables students to excel in technical courses like B.Tech or BCA.
